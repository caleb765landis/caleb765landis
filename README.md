### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Caleb Landis, and I am a full stack developer. I just recently graduated from IUPUI with a B.A. in Applied Computer Science with a minor in Game Design & Development. I've spent time as a lab instructor for the first two introductory computer science classes at IUPUI, and I've also graded for a fundamental web development course as well. My philosophy is you finally know something when you're able to teach it. That means I believe my experience as a teaching assistant was not only beneficial for my students, but for me as well.

I currently live in Pleasant Grove, Utah, and I am looking for new career opportunities! Please feel free to reach out for an interview or just to connect.

If you'd like to see my full resume, you can find the pdf in [this repository](./CalebLandisResume.pdf).

I have a very extensive list of projects from my time at IUPUI. These projects tend to fit into three categories: Web Development, Game Development, and Software Engineering. Below is a grid of all my repositories organized by these three categories, with each project ordered by relevancy in descending order. My favorite projects are also pinned on my GitHub profile page.
